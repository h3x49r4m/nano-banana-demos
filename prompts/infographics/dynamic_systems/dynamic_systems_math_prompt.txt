Create a tall, vertical infographic titled "The Geometry of Change: A Mathematician's Guide to Dynamical Systems." The aesthetic must be elegant, professional, and minimalist, suitable for a high-level academic audience.

**Core Style Instructions:**
- **Background:** A dark, subtly textured background, like fine black paper or charcoal gray canvas.
- **Color Palette:** A single, elegant, glowing accent color, such as gold, silver, or copper, for all lines, diagrams, and text. The overall look should be cohesive and sophisticated.
- **Visuals:** Focus on beautiful, abstract mathematical diagrams and the geometry of phase space. Avoid any literal or cartoonish icons.
- **Typography:** All text should be rendered in a clean, thin, modern sans-serif font. 
- **FORMULA PLACEHOLDERS:** This is critical. Do NOT attempt to render the mathematical formulas. Instead, for each requested formula, create a clean, minimalist, rectangular placeholder box with a faint underline. This box must be left EMPTY, ready for a proper LaTeX-quality equation to be added later.

**Header Section:**
- **Title:** "The Geometry of Change: A Mathematician's Guide to Dynamical Systems"
- **Header Visual:** A large, stunning, and intricate visualization of a complex phase space, such as the Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal model or a fractal attractor, drawn in elegant, thin, glowing golden lines.

**Section 1: The Nature of Time**
- A side-by-side comparison of Continuous and Discrete systems.

**Left Column: Continuous Systems**
- **Visual:** A beautiful, flowing vector field diagram where the vector arrows guide the eye along a smooth, continuous trajectory.
- **Label:** "Continuous-Time"
- **Description:** "System state evolves as a flow described by differential equations."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box for the formula `dx/dt = f(x, t)`.
- **Example Diagram:** An elegant plot of a double pendulum's chaotic but continuous path.

**Right Column: Discrete Systems**
- **Visual:** A crisp, geometric "cobweb plot" or a state transition graph, showing distinct points connected by sharp, straight, glowing lines.
- **Label:** "Discrete-Time"
- **Description:** "System state evolves in iterative steps described by maps."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box for the formula `x_{n+1} = f(x_n)`.
- **Example Diagram:** A diagram showing the first few iterations of the Sierpinski triangle generation.

**Section 2: The Fabric of Phase Space**
- A side-by-side comparison of Linear and Nonlinear systems.

**Left Column: Linear Systems**
- **Visual:** A clean phase portrait of a simple, stable node, where all trajectories are straight or gracefully curved lines moving towards a single point.
- **Label:** "Linear Systems"
- **Description:** "Exhibit predictable behavior, with trajectories that do not intersect."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box for the formula `dx/dt = Ax`.
- **Example Diagram:** A phase portrait of a simple damped harmonic oscillator returning to equilibrium.

**Right Column: Nonlinear Systems**
- **Visual:** A detailed and beautiful rendering of the Lorenz attractor, with its iconic butterfly-wing shape clearly visible as a complex trajectory in 3D space.
- **Label:** "Nonlinear Systems"
- **Description:** "Can exhibit complex phenomena such as bifurcations and chaos."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box for the Lorenz system equations.
- **Example Diagram:** The Lorenz attractor itself serves as the primary visual example.

**Section 3: The Certainty of Evolution**
- A side-by-side comparison of Deterministic and Stochastic systems.

**Left Column: Deterministic Systems**
- **Visual:** A phase portrait where every point in the grid has one and only one clear vector arrow originating from it, defining a unique and unambiguous flow.
- **Label:** "Deterministic Systems"
- **Description:** "The initial state uniquely determines the entire future trajectory."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box, noting that all prior examples are deterministic.
- **Example Diagram:** A clean phase portrait of a simple, undamped pendulum, showing its periodic orbits.

**Right Column: Stochastic Systems**
- **Visual:** A diagram showing a single starting point from which a translucent, expanding "cloud" or "probability distribution" of possible future states emanates. Individual paths within the cloud should be shown as faint, random, jagged trails.
- **Label:** "Stochastic Systems"
- **Description:** "Evolution includes a random component, leading to a distribution of possible outcomes."
- **Formula Placeholder:** An empty box for the SDE `dX_t = a(X_t)dt + b(X_t)dW_t`.
- **Example Diagram:** A diagram illustrating Brownian motion, with a single particle taking a random walk.
