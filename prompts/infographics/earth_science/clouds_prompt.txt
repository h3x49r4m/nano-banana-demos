A visually appealing and educational infographic about the types of clouds.

The infographic should be structured vertically and have a clean, modern design. The background should be a gradient of blue sky, with the highest altitude clouds at the top and the lowest at the bottom.

The infographic should be divided into four main sections by altitude:

1.  **High-Level Clouds (above 20,000 ft):**
    *   **Cirrus:** Illustrated as thin, wispy, and feather-like.
    *   **Cirrocumulus:** Illustrated as small, white patches in a rippling pattern.
    *   **Cirrostratus:** Illustrated as a thin, transparent veil that creates a halo around the sun.

2.  **Mid-Level Clouds (6,500 - 20,000 ft):**
    *   **Altocumulus:** Illustrated as white or gray patches in a layered or wavy pattern.
    *   **Altostratus:** Illustrated as a grayish or bluish sheet covering the sky.

3.  **Low-Level Clouds (below 6,500 ft):**
    *   **Stratus:** Illustrated as a flat, gray, featureless layer.
    *   **Stratocumulus:** Illustrated as lumpy, gray or whitish layers.
    *   **Nimbostratus:** Illustrated as a dark gray, wet-looking layer with falling rain or snow.

4.  **Clouds with Vertical Development:**
    *   **Cumulus:** Illustrated as puffy, cotton-like clouds with flat bases.
    *   **Cumulonimbus:** Illustrated as a towering, dense cloud, with a dark base and an anvil-shaped top. Show lightning bolts coming from it.

Each cloud illustration should be clearly labeled with its name and a brief, one-sentence description of its key characteristic.

The title of the infographic should be "Types of Clouds" in a bold, clean, sans-serif font.

Optionally, include a small section at the bottom for "Special Clouds" with illustrations for:
*   **Mammatus:** Pouch-like clouds.
*   **Lenticular:** Lens-shaped clouds.
*   **Nacreous:** "Mother-of-pearl" clouds with iridescent colors.

The overall tone should be informative, engaging, and easy to understand for a general audience.
