Best Practices

To elevate your results from good to great, incorporate these professional strategies into your workflow.

- Be Hyper-Specific: The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
- Provide Context and Intent: Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output. For example, "Create a logo for a high-end, minimalist skincare brand" will yield better results than just "Create a logo."
 - Iterate and Refine: Don't expect a perfect image on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes. Follow up with prompts like, "That's great, but can you make the lighting a bit warmer?" or "Keep everything the same, but change the character's expression to be more serious."
- Use Step-by-Step Instructions: For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps. "First, create a background of a serene, misty forest at dawn. Then, in the foreground, add a moss-covered ancient stone altar. Finally, place a single, glowing sword on top of the altar."
- Use "Semantic Negative Prompts": Instead of saying "no cars," describe the desired scene positively: "an empty, deserted street with no signs of traffic."
- Control the Camera: Use photographic and cinematic language to control the composition. Terms like wide-angle shot, macro shot, low-angle perspective.
