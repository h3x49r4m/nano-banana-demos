Here is a detailed and accurate explanation of the water cycle, which describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface.

The entire cycle is driven by energy from the sun and the force of gravity.

### The Main Stages of the Water Cycle

1.  **Evaporation: Water Turns into Gas**
    *   **What it is:** This is the process where liquid water transforms into water vapor (a gas) and rises into the atmosphere.
    *   **How it happens:** The sun's energy heats water in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers, giving water molecules enough energy to break free and become a gas. The vast majority of evaporation comes from the oceans.

2.  **Condensation: Gas Turns into Clouds**
    *   **What it is:** As the warm, moist air rises, it cools down. Condensation is the process where this water vapor turns back into tiny liquid water droplets or ice crystals.
    *   **How it happens:** These microscopic droplets cling to tiny particles in the air (like dust or salt) and gather together to form the clouds we can see.

3.  **Precipitation: Water Falls to Earth**
    *   **What it is:** This is the release of water from the clouds back to the Earth's surface.
    *   **How it happens:** When the water droplets or ice crystals in clouds grow large and heavy enough, gravity pulls them down. Precipitation can be in the form of **rain** (liquid), **snow** (ice crystals), **sleet**, or **hail**.

4.  **Collection: Water Gathers on the Ground**
    *   **What it is:** After falling to Earth, the water is collected and stored.
    *   **How it happens:** Water can fall directly into oceans, lakes, and rivers. On land, it can either flow over the surface as **runoff**, eventually reaching a body of water, or it can soak into the ground.

### Other Important Processes in the Cycle

*   **Transpiration:** This is essentially evaporation from plants. Plants absorb water through their roots and then release it as water vapor from their leaves.
*   **Sublimation:** This is when solid water, like snow and ice, turns directly into water vapor without melting into a liquid first. It's common at high altitudes with low air pressure.
*   **Infiltration:** This is the process of water soaking into the ground from the surface. This water can then be stored in underground aquifers.
*   **Groundwater Flow:** Water that has infiltrated the ground moves slowly underground and can eventually seep back into rivers, lakes, or the ocean to rejoin the cycle.

From there, the sun's energy starts the process of evaporation all over again, continuing the endless and essential circulation of water.
