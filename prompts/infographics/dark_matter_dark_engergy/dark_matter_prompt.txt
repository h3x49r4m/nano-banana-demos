Create a tall, vertical infographic titled "The Invisible Universe: A Guide to Dark Matter & Dark Energy." The overall style should be a clean, modern vector illustration with a flat design aesthetic, set against a deep space background (dark blues and purples). Use vibrant, glowing accent colors (like neon blue for matter and magenta for energy) to make the information pop.

**Top Section: The Hook**
- At the very top, feature the text: "Less than 5% of the universe is the stars, planets, and galaxies we can see. The other 95% is a mystery."

**Central Graphic: The Cosmic Inventory**
- Below the hook, display a large, elegant pie chart as the centerpiece.
- The pie chart should be divided into three sections with clear labels and small, simple icons:
  - **68% Dark Energy:** Labeled with a 'pushing apart' icon (e.g., four arrows pointing outwards from a center point).
  - **27% Dark Matter:** Labeled with a 'pulling together' icon (e.g., four arrows pointing inwards to a center point).
  - **5% Normal Matter:** Labeled with a simple star or galaxy icon.

**Two Columns Section:**
- Below the pie chart, the infographic should split into two distinct columns with clear headings.

**Left Column: DARK MATTER**
- **Tagline:** "The Universe's Invisible Scaffolding"
- **"What is it?" text:** "An invisible substance whose gravity pulls galaxies together."
- **Evidence Section (with icons and diagrams):**
  - **Icon 1 (Galaxy Rotation):** A diagram of a spiral galaxy. Show straight arrows of the same length for both inner and outer stars to illustrate they are moving at the same speed. Label it: "Stars at the galaxy edge spin too fast to stay in orbit... unless an invisible 'halo' of dark matter is holding them in."
  - **Icon 2 (Gravitational Lensing):** A diagram showing a massive, abstract galaxy cluster. Illustrate light from a distant, smaller galaxy bending around the cluster before reaching an observer icon (a simple eye or telescope). Label it: "Massive clusters bend light more than their visible matter can account for."
- **"What could it be?" text:** "Mysterious new particles like WIMPs or Axions."

**Right Column: DARK ENERGY**
- **Tagline:** "The Universe's Repulsive Force"
- **"What is it?" text:** "A mysterious energy that pushes everything apart, accelerating the universe's expansion."
- **Evidence Section (with a diagram):**
  - **Diagram (Accelerating Expansion):** A cone-shaped timeline, starting narrow at the bottom (labeled "Big Bang") and flaring outwards towards the top (labeled "Present Day"). Show small supernova icons on the timeline, getting farther apart faster as they approach the top. Label it: "Distant supernovae are farther away than expected, proving the universe's expansion is speeding up."
- **"What could it be?" text:** "An energy built into space itself, like a Cosmological Constant or Quintessence."

**Footer/Conclusion:**
- A simple, concluding statement at the bottom: "Dark Matter pulls structures together while Dark Energy pushes them apart. Unraveling their secrets is the next great frontier in physics."

Ensure all typography is clean, sans-serif, and highly legible against the dark background.
