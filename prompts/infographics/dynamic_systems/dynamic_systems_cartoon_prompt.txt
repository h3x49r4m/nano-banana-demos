Create a tall, vertical infographic titled "A Wild Guide to the Universe's Quirky Rules!" The overall style should be a vibrant, whimsical, and funny cartoon. Use a bright, saturated color palette and dynamic character illustrations, similar to a modern webcomic. All text should be rendered in a playful, bold, hand-drawn style font.

**Header Section:**
- Title: "A Wild Guide to the Universe's Quirky Rules!"
- A funny cartoon brain character looking confused, with the subtitle: "What makes the world tick? Meet the Dynamical Systems!"

**Section 1: How Time Flows (Or Hops!)**
- A section comparing two funny characters.

**Left Side: Continuous-Time**
- **Character:** A sleepy, melting snail character sliding down a smooth, slippery ramp. He's leaving a single, unbroken slime trail.
- **Label:** "Continuous-Time: I just gooo with the floooow..."
- **Example:** The snail is looking back at his trail, which is labeled "Example: A slimy, continuous trail."

**Right Side: Discrete-Time**
- **Character:** A hyper-active, blocky robot kangaroo, hopping rigidly from one floating square platform to the next.
- **Label:** "Discrete-Time: One! Hop! At! A! Time!"
- **Example:** The platforms the robot is hopping on are labeled "Example: Hopping from one distinct spot to the next."

**Section 2: Simple Rules vs. Utter Chaos!**
- A section comparing a predictable character to a chaotic one.

**Left Side: Linear**
- **Character:** A very prim and proper, robot butler character walking a perfectly straight tightrope. He is holding a tray with a drink that is not spilling.
- **Label:** "Linear: So predictable! What you put in is what you get out."
- **Example:** The butler is pointing to a cartoon vending machine labeled "Example: 1 coin = 1 soda. Always."

**Right Side: Nonlinear**
- **Character:** A wild-haired cartoon scientist being launched from a giant, complex Rube Goldberg machine that started with a tiny mouse pulling a string.
- **Label:** "Nonlinear: A tiny nudge can cause total mayhem!"
- **Example:** The chaotic machine is labeled "Example: This ridiculously complicated contraption."

**Section 3: Fortune Teller or Total Guesswork?**
- A section comparing a confident character to a confused one.

**Left Side: Deterministic**
- **Character:** A smug-looking cartoon fortune teller with a crystal ball, pointing confidently down a single, straight, brightly-lit road.
- **Label:** "Deterministic: I know EXACTLY how this story ends!"
- **Example:** The road is made of falling dominoes, labeled "Example: A perfect domino chain reaction."

**Right Side: Stochastic**
- **Character:** The same fortune teller, but now looking panicked, shrugging with his hands up as the road immediately splits into a tangled, spaghetti-like mess of dozens of possible paths.
- **Label:** "Stochastic: Your guess is as good as mine!"
- **Example:** One of the tangled paths leads to a cartoon cat about to knock a vase off a table, labeled "Example: Will the cat do it? Who knows!"
